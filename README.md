#  Air Quality Classification Using Machine Learning

This project applies various machine learning models to classify air quality levels using real-world pollution data.

##  Project Goals
- Load and explore air pollution data
- Preprocess data (encoding, scaling, balancing)
- Train and evaluate multiple classifiers
- Compare performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

##  Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- MLPClassifier (Neural Network)
- Stacking Classifier

##  Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix

##  Dataset
The dataset is named `updated_pollution_dataset.csv`, which includes features like:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind
- Air Quality label (target)


##  Libraries Used
- `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `imblearn` (for NearMiss undersampling)

##  Sample Output
